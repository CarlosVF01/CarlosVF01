### Hi everyone! I'm Carlos, spanish backend developer.

This account is quite inactive as I use another one for work (**grave mistake, never do that!**), but I might sometimes upload cool stuff if I feel like trying to code something that I might use myself,
such as... *Youtube audio player on Discord after they killed Groovy cough cough*.

I've mostly used Java for development, much of it with Vert.x/JavaRx but also some Spring Framework.

In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching anime and all that geek stuff that you can think of, *I also play the piano though*.
